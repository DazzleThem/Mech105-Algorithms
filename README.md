# Mech105-Algorithms
Contains assigned algorithms from the spring 2018 numerical methods (MECH 105) class at CSU. Each algorithm is stored in a separate folder with an associated README. Each README includes detailed information on the code, usage, and known bugs. The algorithms are LUFactor, Simpson, and falsePosition.
